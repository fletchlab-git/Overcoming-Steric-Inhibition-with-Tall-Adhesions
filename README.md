**Monte Carlo Simulation for Membrane-Surface Interactions**

This readme describes the architecture of a Monte Carlo simulation code that models the interaction between a flexible membrane and a rigid surface, both decorated with adhesive and non-adhesive molecules.

### Three-Module Architecture

**Module 1: Monte_Carlo_Simulation**

A Python program controls a C code called "LatticeMembrane" (running on Linux) that executes the Monte Carlo simulation. The Python code allows you to adjust input parameters such as the height, density, and interactions of molecules on each surface. 

For each distance Z imposed by a bias potential between the two surfaces, the LatticeMembrane code performs 2 million Monte Carlo sweeps and calculates various quantities (bias energy, mesh energy, total energy, potential energy, membrane average separation, etc.). Results are stored in a data_Z_zvalue.dat file. All results are grouped in a "Simulation_Results" folder containing one data_Z_zvalue.dat file for each imposed Z.

**Module 2: Free_Energy_Profile_Calculation**

A Python script analyzes the data generated by Module 1. It takes the "Simulation_Results" folder as input and calculates the free energy profile as a function of distance Z. The output is a Free_Energy.dat file containing the free energy F(Z).

**Module 3: Kinetic_Rate_Calculation**

A third Python script uses the free energy profiles from Free_Energy.dat to calculate the kinetic rate of short binder engagement, expressed as the ratio Kshort / Kdiff, where Kdiff represents the diffusion-limited kinetic rate. For each input F(Z) profile, the script generates a Kshort / Kdiff value and stores it in a Kinetic_Rate.csv file.
